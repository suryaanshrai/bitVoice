# Large Models (If we want to avoid copying local models and prefer downloading in build or mounting)
# However, if user HAS models locally and wants them in image, we might NOT ignore them.
# Given the Dockerfile does "COPY models/ /app/models/", we should probably NOT ignore them here 
# UNLESS the intention is to force users to use volume or download in build.
# For "optimized for sharing", we probably don't want to COPY 300MB+ files from context up to daemon every build.
# But specific instructions said "Auto-downloaded...".
# I'll ignore the large model files to keep context light, assuming usage of volumes or build steps.
