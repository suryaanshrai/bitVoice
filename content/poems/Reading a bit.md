Have you ever read a long story?

Multi-novel, spanning-across-years story?

How does it feel to reach the end of it?

It is awe-inspiring. Isn't it?

The feeling of reaching the end of it?

  <br>
  

You finished the entire story, it is an achievement!

But sorrow one feels to close the book instead.

That story was good, you never wanted it to end.

Yet you close the book, reminiscing on every chapter you read.

Every little detail of those unreal characters,

It makes the heart beat in sync with their calendars.

  <br>
  

But every story in this world has the same plot,

They all come to an end, happy or not.

So close this book, finish this chapter,

Another story awaits for it to be unraveled,

It might not be as good as this,

But it is a new one, not the same old rubbish.

<br>

  

With so many stories and so many books,

I will not lay an accuse,

Nor a plea, nor a wish,

To the author of a story that has finished.

  <br>
  

Yet you talk about the characters with your loved ones,

But stretched fate is a path for the devil to come,

Hence, another book shall I pick,

But maybe not now, since my library is filled.
